# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 15, 2026

RageBaiter is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle data when you use the RageBaiter Chrome Extension.

## 1. Data Collected

### a. Personal Information

RageBaiter does not require you to create an account with us directly. We may store an anonymous identifier to associate your political compass results and feedback with your browser installation.

### b. Extension Data

- **Political Compass Results:** We store the results of the optional political compass quiz to provide personalized Socratic interventions.
- **Tweet IDs:** We process tweet IDs from Twitter/X to check for political bias and logical fallacies.
- **User Feedback:** We collect your feedback on interventions (e.g., if you found them helpful) to improve our detection models.

### c. API Keys

- **LLM Keys:** If you provide your own API keys for LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic), these keys are **stored locally** in your browser's secure storage. They are **never** sent to our backend servers.

## 2. Storage Locations

- **Local Storage:** Extension settings, political compass results, and LLM API keys are stored locally on your device using the `chrome.storage` API.
- **Cloud Storage:** Anonymous political vectors and tweet analysis results are stored in our secure backend database (Supabase) to enable caching and improved analysis for all users.

## 3. Data Retention

We retain anonymous analysis data and feedback indefinitely to improve the service. You can request the deletion of your specific data through the extension settings.

## 4. Deletion and Export Rights

Under the "Settings" tab in the RageBaiter side panel, you have the right to:

- **Export Data:** Download a copy of the data associated with your anonymous identifier.
- **Delete Data:** Permanently delete your political profile and feedback from our backend servers.

## 5. Third-Party Processing

- **Google Gemini / OpenAI / Anthropic:** Tweet text is sent to these providers for analysis. This data is processed according to their respective privacy policies. We do not send your personal identifiers or your own API keys to our shared backend analysis providers.

## 6. Security

We use industry-standard encryption and security practices to protect your data. Communication between the extension and our backend is secured via HTTPS and internal API authentication.

## 7. Compliance

RageBaiter complies with the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, ensuring that we only request the minimum permissions necessary and handle your data transparently.
